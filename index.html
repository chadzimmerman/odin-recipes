    <a href="recipes/salad.html">Roasted Beetroot Salad</a>
    <p>This beetroot salad was a big hit with Svetlana and I when I first cooked it. 
        After Sveta cooked a lovely borsch dinner for us the night before, 
        we just so happened to have leftover beets! With cooking more borscht 
        sadly out of the question... I needed a new method for preparing these 
        ruby-red beauties! This recipe pulls out all the best features of the 
        beetroot, and combines it with the varying tastes and textures that 
        borscht simply cannot accommodate.</p>

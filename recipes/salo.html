    <h3>The Taste of the <em>Old Country</em></h3>
    <p class="center">Nothing taste's like cool winter evenings at the family <em>Dacha</em> like
       cold salo, black bread and a crisp, freshing Kvass. This recipe is a family
       tradition, a tale of an entire group of people's struggle, triumph and culture... and
       It's pretty darn tasty, too!</p>
    <p class="center">Being such a simple recipe, it only takes a handful of ingredients to make. 
        That being said, the patience to let the pork fat properly salt and preserve
        is the real challenge! A lesson in history, cooking and patience: lets cook some Salo!

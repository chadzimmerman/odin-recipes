    <h3>The Last-Minute "Borscht Killer"</h3>
    <p>This <em>beetroot salad</em> was a big hit with Svetlana and I when I first cooked it. 
        After Sveta cooked a lovely borsch dinner for us the night before, 
        we just so happened to have leftover beets! With cooking more borscht 
        sadly out of the question... I needed a new method for preparing these 
        ruby-red beauties! This recipe pulls out all the best features of the 
        beetroot, and combines it with the varying tastes and textures that 
        borscht simply cannot accommodate.</p>
        <p>This simple but tasty take on a regular beetroot salad takes the flavor to the next level
            by roasted the beets, caramelizing the sugars, and deepening the rich earth aromas.
            Mixed with this are crispy spinach leaves, crunchy roasted walnuts, and a tart lemon
            Vinaigrette. All these combine to not just an elevation of leftover broscht fodder, 
            but a <strong>MASSIVE</strong> upgrade in summer dinner-date nights!
